This is the file CJKspace.txt of the CJK macro package ver. 4.8.3
(07-May-2012).

CJKspace.sty
------------

This package provides a modified `CJK*' environment which suppresses spaces
between CJK characters only. Its main usage are documents written in
English with frequent insertions of CJK words or phrases and modern Chinese
documents which do the opposite.

Note that this package is not optimal for Japanese since typographic
conventions mandate the use of shibuaki spaces (see `japanese/shibuaki.txt'
for more details); this can't be handled automatically with traditional TeX.

Usage:

  \usepackage{CJK}
  \usepackage{CJKspace}
