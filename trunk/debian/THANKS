I would like to thank the following people:

 * Anthony Fok, the Debian packager of cjk-latex, which has been the base
   for this package.
 * Janusz S. Bie≈Ñ, who provided me with some very valuable tips.
 * Tomasz Starosta, who packaged the TeXlive version of the LaTeX CJK macro.
   I used his package to get Korean support working.
 * Werner Lemberg, the main author of LaTeX CJK.
