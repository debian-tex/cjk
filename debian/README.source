cjk for Debian
--------------

1. Getting the source file
--------------------------

The upstream source tarball is created each time you build the package using the
`get-orig-source' target in debian/rules.  This target will look at the `debian/
changelog' file and use the ISO date that is provided in the package version
numbering.

For instance, if the first line of the Debian changelog file looks like:
cjk (4.8.2+git20090105-1) unstable; urgency=medium
then it will strip off `4.8.2+git' and `-1' from the version, so you get the
date `20090105'.

The `get-orig-source' target will now transform that date into Unix time, and
use this to fetch a tarball from the upstream GIT server up to 5 January 2009.

You may ask yourself why I bother using this mechanism.  I find it often quite
cumbersome to recreate the original source tarball for each and every release.
There are naming conventions to abide by, and I keep forgetting them.  Hence
this system in which I just have to modify the Debian version in the changelog
to get an updated upstream tarball, completely according to the conventions that
apply on Debian.

In other words, when you are in the "cjk" folder, just run:
$ ./debian/rules get-orig-source
