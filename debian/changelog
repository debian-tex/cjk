cjk (4.8.2+git20090105-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Find Kimchi" release.
  * [patches/09_fix_korean_fd_files.diff] Finally update the Korean font
    definition files to work together with the ko.tex packages instead of
    the obsolete HLaTeX packages.  This fixes "Some HLaTeX font references

  * [debian/control]
     - Remove the build-dependency on the `sharutils' package: we do not
       use `uuencode' anymore in debian/rules since cjk (4.8.2+git20090105-1);
     - bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4; no changes.
  * [debian/source/format] Really switch to Debian Source v3.0 (quilt)
     this time.

     - remove binary ad other files in utils/ created during compile time;
     - fix the "get-orig-source" target to work with /bin/sh pointing to
       dash.

cjk (4.8.2+git20090105-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "How do you hyphenate `Eve'" release.
  * Setting the urgency to "medium" because it fixes an important bug
    that renders parts of TeXlive not properly configured.
  * [control]
     - Move myself to "Uploaders", move Debian TeX Maintainers
       to "Maintainer", and add Norbert Preining to the list of
       Uploaders;
     - (Build-)Depend on tex-common (>= 2.04) in order to solve the
       bug below.
  * [rules] Switch from "dh_installtex [...] hyphen=pinyin,pyhyph.tex"
     to "[...] hyphen=pinyin,loadhyph-zh-latn.tex,lhm=1,rhm=1".
     The hyph-utf8 package requires all hyphenation patterns to be in
     UTF-8 encoding, and has its own modified pyhyph.tex file.
     Many thanks to Norbert Preining.  This fixes the bug "hyphenation
     definition is wrong, cannot be loaded with luatex" (Closes: #562198).

  * [control]
     - Depend and Build-Depend on tex-common (>= 2.03) due to syntax
       changes with dh_installtex;
     - only use one email address in the "Maintainer" field: move the
       Debian TeX ML address to "Uploaders" instead and remove my own
       email address from the "Uploaders" field.  This should fix bug
       "Erroneous Maintainer field" (Closes: #561789); thanks to Florian
       Ernst for the bug report.
  * Rebuild against libkpathsea-dev as it has bumped to v5.

     - bump Standards-Version from 3.8.2 to 3.8.3 (no changes);
     - add "Debian TeX maintainers" to the Maintainer: line;
     - add myself to the Uploaders: line.

     - Bug fix: "FTBFS: cp: cannot stat `...{garuda,norasi}*.afm':", thanks
       to Lucas Nussbaum (Closes: #543025);
     - change the maintainer's email address.
   * [README.source] New file, that explains how the original source tarball
      is created.  This fixes a Lintian warning and is in compliance with
      Standards-Version 3.8.0.

cjk (4.8.2+git20090105-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "GIT+SVN" release.
  * New upstream release:
     - Fixes some XeLaTeX issues with the language files;
     - adds support for CID-keyed fonts in the Fontforge scripts;
     - adds the \CJKdigits* command to use the traditional form of
       "zero";
     - adds the \Unicode command to use vertical glyph representation
       forms;
     - uses the original font names of ThaiLaTeX 0.4.2;
     - DNP.txt is now renamed to wadalab.txt;
     - a new CJKnumb.txt document is available, which explains the "CJKnumb"
       package;
     - extra documentation in CJK.txt about using the beamer class in
       conjunction with CJKutf8.
  * [control]
     - Add Homepage tag;
     - switch from XS-Vcs to Vcs-*;
     - use Debian Alioth's SVN address instead of upstream's GIT
       address;
     - add a build-dependency on git-core and tex-common (>= 1.18), the
       latter providing trigger support;
     - add a dependency on tex-common (>= 1.18) for every binary package;
     - fix a fair Lintian warning by adding a dependency on ${misc:Depends}
       for latex-cjk-{all,korean,xcjk} and cjk-latex, ignoring a harmless
       warning from dpkg-gencontrol for latex-cjk-all and cjk-latex
       ("unknown substitution variable");
     - bump Standards-Version from 3.8.0 to 3.8.2 (no changes);
     - add a build-dependency on an unversioned thailatex, which should
       allow for a clean pbuilder/cowbuilder build.  Thanks to Norbert
       Preining.
  * [rules]
     - Bug fix: "bashism in debian/rules", thanks to Raphael Geissert
       (Closes: #535375);
     - add a new "get-orig-source" target to package the orig.tar.gz file
       from the upstream GIT repository directly;
     - upstream is now compatible with Type1 fonts from ThaiLaTeX v0.4.2,
       which deprecates the use of a prepackaged set of fonts.  The fontmap
       files now have a "-c90" appended to them, i.e. "norasi-c90" and
       "garuda-c90".
  * [thaifonts.tar.gz.uu] Removed, because CJK is now fully compatible with
     fonts from the ThaiLaTeX package.
  * [patches/00list] Remove 05_fix_examplefiles.dpatch from the list,
     as the upstream release now uses CJKutf8 and does not rely on the
     non-free Bitstream Cyberbit font anymore.  This also closes an
     Ubuntu bugreport requesting to replace the Cyberbit fonts in the
     example files (LP: #180529).  Also add patches 07 and 08.
  * [patches/*]
     - Modify them to support CJK version 4.8.2;
     - don't make these patches executable anymore.
  * [patches/04_extend_examplefiles.dpatch]
     - This patch has commented out the Korean part of the CJKutf8.tex
       file since May 2007, which closes an Ubuntu bugreport (LP: #137761).
  * [patches/07_remove_unnecessary_C_libs.dpatch] Add but do not yet apply
     this patch intended to fix some of the dpkg-shlibdeps warnings.
  * [patches/08_add_newpage_to_examples.dpatch] Add \newpage in the example
     files before \end{CJK*} to solve potential \write issues in longer
     documents when you include \tableofcontents.
  * [latex-cjk-common.docs] Add CJKnumb.txt to the list of documents.
  * [latex-cjk-japanese.install] Remove DNP.txt and add wadalab.txt.

     - make the macron work again with Plain TeX in pinyin.sty;
     - make the macros in pinyin.sty robust.
  * [copyright] Major changes, adding several licenses and authorship
     information.  Thanks to Mark Hymers for pointing this out.

cjk (4.8.0+git20080522-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "I love you, XeLaTeX" release.
  * I build the .orig.tar.gz file now with
    "git-buildpackage --git-ignore-new --git-upstream-branch=master".
  * New upstream release:
     - add SUN Wenchang's xCJK bundle to add support for XeLaTeX;
     - some more information is added upstream to support Bitstream's
       Cyberbit font;
     - new command "\CJKbaselinestretch" to adjust the baseline stretch
       during vertical typesetting;
     - make \CJK@bold work with SJIS encoding too;
     - supports EUC-JP with DNP font encoding.
  * [compat] Upgrade from debhelper V5 to V7.
  * [changelog] Fix small typo.
  * [control]
     - Depend on debhelper (>= 7);
     - bump Standards-Version from 3.7.3 to 3.8.0;
     - remove ", hlatex-fonts-base, ${misc:Depends}" from the
       description in latex-cjk-korean.  Apparently I copied it
       as a reminder for me, but forgot to remove it afterwards.
       Thanks to Simon Huggins (Closes: #466398);
     - recommend "texlive-xetex" for latex-cjk-common;
     - create a new package called "latex-cjk-xcjk", which also suggest
       several DFSG-free TTF packages.  Most Thai fonts are still a bit
       problematic though;
     - let latex-cjk-common depend on texlive-font-utils instead of suggesting
       the deprecated freetype1-tools.  Thanks to Osamu Aoki and Norbert
       Preining (Closes: #482554).
  * [rules]
     - Fix bashisms.  Thanks to Raphael Geissert for the bugreport and
       Chris Lamb for the patch (Closes: #478363);
     - remove the generated hbf2gf.c at cleanup time to fix Lintian warning
       "patch-system-but-direct-changes-in-diff utils/hbf2gf/hbf2gf.c".
  * [latex-cjk-common.docs] Bug fix: "bashisms in docs files" (Closes: #480868).
  * [latex-cjk-common.install] Clean up the file.
  * [latex-cjk-japanese.install] Add EUC-JPdnp.enc.
  * [*.install,latex-cjk-common.examples] Fix so-called "bashisms".
  * [debian/xCJK-extended.{tex,pdf}] Add my own example file for xCJK, showing
     a lot more fonts that could be used on Debian.
  * [latex-cjk-xcjk.install] Install all the files for xCJK.
  * [patches/*] Modify to work with CJK version 4.8.0.

  * Acknowledge the NMU.  Thanks to Lucas Nussbaum.
  * New upstream release:
     - a few fixes for PinYin;
     - fix punctuation in GBK and math mode;
     - dvipdfmx can now make use the correct /ToUnicode CMap;
     - fix a few typo's.
  * [latex-cjk-japanese.install] Install DNP.sfd in
     /usr/share/texmf/fonts/sfd/.  Thanks to Gernot Hassenpflug
     (Closes: #434478).
  * [README.Debian]
     - change 10cyberbit.cfg into 20cyberbit.cfg.
    [README.Debian-msgothic] Add some DIY information how to get the Japanese
     Gothic font from Microsoft working under CJK.  This is largely based on
     Gernot Hassenplug's HOWTO.  This is a work in progress, however, as I've
     stumbled upon a segmentation fault in Fontforge.
  * [control]
     - Bump Standards-Version from 3.7.2.0 to.7.3;
     - make latex-cjk-korean depend on "ko.tex-extra-hlfont" instead of
       the old "hlatex-fonts-extra".  Thanks to Changwoo Ryu
       (Closes: #462025).
  * [rules]
     - fix bashism: apparently other shells don't understand the accolade.
       Thanks to Mario Bonino for the report and Lucas Nussbaum for the NMU
       which closed #457710;
     - change /usr/bin/rename to /usr/bin/prename;
     - don't install the empty "CEF/" directory in $TEXMF; the
       hbf-* packages will take care of this in the future.

cjk (4.7.0+git20070708-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "arch enemy and indep nemesis battle together" release.
  * New upstream release:
     - fix the \ding PinYin syllable.
  * [rules]
     - Move several blocks of code from the install: target to the
       build: target.  Also create build-arch: and build-indep: targets.
       Moreover, I have finally discovered the -a and -i debhelper
       options.
       My gratitude goes towards Norbert Preining who helped me
       immensely to go through this process;
     - move latex-cjk-thai to the binary-indep: target.  At build time
       it needs to compile arch-dependent stuff, but in the end all the
       installed files are arch-independent;
     - no need to manually remove utils/hbf2gf/hbf2gf.c anymore when
       cleaning.
     - move latex-cjk-{korean,thai,all} and cjk-all from the
       binary-dep target to binary-indep.  This should remove a few
       warnings in the buildd logs.
  * [rules,patches/03_Makefile.dpatch]
     Add extra check to see if the upstream Makefile has been
     dpatched already.  If so, continue with the cleaning targets.
     This removes a Lintian warning.  Thanks to Norbert Preining.
  * [control] Put texlive-font-utils and sharutils back to
     Build-Depends-Indep, due to latex-cjk-thai truly being
     arch-independent now.
  * Temporarily add the Japanese HBF .fd files, so the Japanese
    hbf-* packages can be used with CJK.  I hope to overtake all
    the hbf-* packages and repackage them.  They will each
    individually contain the necessary .fd files.  Meanwhile, I
    will provide the .fd files only for in latex-cjk-japanese.
    This fixes "latex-cjk-japanese: c40song.fd is not included".
    Thanks to Francis Bond (Closes: #431038).

     - minor cleanup, and add dependencies on "${misc:Depends}" and

     - we can now safely remove the backup dependency on teTeX completely;
     - change build-dependency on "libkpathsea4-dev" to "libkpathsea-dev".
       This should allow sucessful builds for arm and sparc architectures
       again, and allow the packages to go into testing on all architectures;
     - add XS-Vcs-* tags;
     - debhelper and dpatch stay in Build-Depends, rest goes to

cjk (4.7.0+git20070504-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.  Highlights:
     - allow vertical shifting for horizontal CJK glyphs (very
       handy for e.g. the Arphic fonts);
     - document special space handling for Emacs quail input method;
     - support T5 encoding;
     - switch to GIT repository.
  * [control]
     - Build-Depend on "texlive-extra-utils", which provides "ctangle".
       This fixes "FTBFS: ctangle: Command not found" (Closes: #421981).
       Thanks to Martin Michlmayr;
     - Build-Depend on "texlive-font-utils", which provides "fontinst";
     - rewrite the package information text of latex-cjk-korean.
  * [rules]
     - Add "dh_shlibdeps".  This fixes "FTBFS: hbf2gf: error while
       loading shared libraries: libkpathsea.so.4: cannot open shared
       object file: No such file or directory" (Closes: #422629).
       Thanks to Lucas Nussbaum, Michael Ablassmeier and Frank Küster;
     - build from the GIT source.
  * [rules] reverse the order of the build-dependency on TeX packages,
     making TeXlive the preferred flavour.
  * [README.Debian] make it clear that compiling fonts with Fontforge
     takes a *lot* of time, up to a full day.  This will only be relevant
     if you build the Debian package yourself.  Thanks Werner LEMBERG.
  * Make latex-cjk-all also depend on the font packages instead of a
    recommendation.  This will clear much of the confusion for new users.
    The font packages are only recommended by their respective latex-cjk-*
    subpackage, so you can still choose not to install them by uninstalling
    latex-cjk-all and keeping each individual latex-cjk-* subpackage.
  * [patches/04_extend_examplefiles.dpatch]
     - Add information about which texlive-lang-* packages need to be
       installed for all the different languages;
     - also comment out the Korean blocks in UTF-8; we're currently lacking
       some Unicode fonts;
     - extend the Big5.tex example; make use of Chinese captions.
  * [patches/06_extend_JIS_example.dpatch] the JIS example file now
     showcases all three Wadalab flavours (Mincho, Gothic and Maru),
     CJKcaption and Japanese section titles.
  * [*emacsen.*] Symlink the .el files in the compiled elisp
     directories from all the Emacs flavours as well, in order to please
     some functions like "M-x find-function".

cjk (4.7.0+cvs20061019-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * The "Purge the purging problem" release.
  * Urgency set to high because of an RC bug.
  * [*.postinst,*.postrm] remove these files.
    [rules] add dh_installtex to -common, -japanese and -korean
     instead of using their own *.post* scripts, allowing
     the CJK packages to be purged when kpsewhich isn't available
     anymore.  Thanks to Lucas Nussbaum (Closes: #392359).
  * [rules] pyhyphen got priority 10, making it the preferred
     hyphenation table.  This would give strange results, such as "g-rou-ps",
     because "rou" is a Mandarin Chinese syllable.
     I've set pyhyphen's priority to 20 now.  Thanks for reporting this,
     Dylan Thurston (Closes: #399447).

  * The "All Saints Day" release.
  * New upstream release.  Highlights:
     - documentation updates;
     - handle 0x80 in UTF8 and CJK.sty.  Thanks to Gulfstream
       for the Debian bug report (Closes: #396142);
     - more tidbits for glyphs > U+FFFF.
  * [changelog] remove all the debian/ subdirectory references.

  * [watch] change
     http://cjk.ffii.org/index.html cjk-current\.tar\.gz into

     see what difference it makes.
  * [rules] according to Debian Policy section 4.6, it is advised
     to use a double ampersand instead of a semicolon because of
     "sh"'s poor error trapping.

       monolithic.  Thanks to LUK ShunTim (Closes: 392982);

  * The "Whoa!" release.
  * New upstream release.  Highlights:
     - PDF files compiled by pdfTeX/pdfLaTeX will from now on have
       copy/paste abilities in CJKutf8; dvipdfmx-produced PDF files OTOH
       have since long been able to copy/paste characters, and is not
       restricted to CJKutf8;
     - fix position of \part in ToC;
     - fix use of \chapter in KOMA's scrartcl;
     - caption texts for KOMA now also for UTF-8;
     - fix \CJKbold to coexist with the "fourier" package;
     - several Debian patches are now implemented upstream;
     - hlatex2agl.pl now takes an extra argument for the SFD file;
     - wftodm.c now compiles cleanly on AMD64.
  * [latex-cjk-{chinese,japanese,korean}.install] install the
     new .cpx files.
  * [latex-cjk-korean.install] don't install c70mj.fd.
     It's pretty useless without the fonts.
  * [rules] remove the ctangle generated utils/hbf2gf/hbf2gf.c
     after building the .deb packages.  This line will disappear when
     version 4.8.0 gets packaged.

  * [arphic-sampler.tex] change \usepackage{CJK} into
     \usepackage[T1]{CJKutf8}.
  * [patches/05_fix_examplefiles] fix UTF8.tex (cyberb00->cyberbit00).
  * [rules] Mamma mia!  I forgot to rename norasi.* to
     norasin.* and garuda.* to garudan.*.  Now Thai works 100%.
  * [README.Debian]
     - add a new section "Example files" and mention that the package
       "type1ec" that is sometimes used in the example files require
       the package "cm-super" to be installed.  This has however
       nothing to do with CJK;
     - mention the example files that don't work (yet).  This is mostly
       because of the absence of Korean fonts in Unicode.  I'm working on
       it with the upstream author.
  * [control]
     - make everything binNMU-safe;
     - change the maintainer's email address.

  * The "Thank you Frank" release.
  * Upload sponsored by Frank Küster <frank@debian.org>.
  * New upstream release: fixes typo in ChangeLog.
  * [rules] ctangle causes an FTBFS on my new AMD64
     because of an @ sign, even though it's commented.  Dunno why it
     happens, but in the meantime I added a sed command to change it to
    "_at_".  It's also removed at the start of every build.
  * [cjklatex.1]
     use only one manpage and symlink it to all *latex batch commands.
     bg5latex.1, bg5+latex.1 and sjislatex.1 in debian/ are therefore
     also removed.
  * [control]
     - change dependency from libkpathsea4-dev to libkpathsea-dev
     - add build-dependency on perl-base (>=5.8.0) and tetex-bin
     - recommend the official freetype1-tools (>= 1.4pre.20050518-0.3)
       instead of my own version.
  * [patches/04_fix_undiffing.dpatch]
     add some GPL headers back before cleaning because they get removed
     when the .c files are recreated by ctangle.  This causes "dpatch
     deapply" to fail, because it expects those GPL headers to be still
     there, just like in the upstream tarball.
  * [README.Debian] some small corrections in the Cyberbit
     section.

  * [copyright] change 1998 to 2006, and change the upstream

  * [control] remove the names of Lemberg and Fok, modify the
     description of latex-cjk-chinese a bit and make the packages
     conflict with cjk-latex (<=4.5.1) rather than (<=4.5.1-4).
  * [README.Debian] I rewrote parts of it:
     - I forgot to translate some parts from Dutch to English;
     - remove the part about ttf2pk; I haven't tested it thoroughly
       enough;

     - new encoding "HK" (C05) for Hong Kong's HKSCS-2004;
     - Unicode and document fixes;

  * The "Final touches" release.
  * PDF, PS and DVI versions of the example files are no longer provided.
     They were (IMHO) useless anyway, and just consumed space unnecessarily.
  * [arphic-sampler.tex] use an updated Arphic examples files for
     the latex-cjk-chinese package, and remove the old arphic.tar.gz.uu
     with PDF files in the Debian source package.
  * Use dpatch for the modifications to the upstream Makefile.
  * [control] add sharutils back in Build-Depends (the Thai fonts
     come UUencoded in the Debian source package).
  * [control] make tfm-arphic-* conflict conflict with the
     latex-cjk-chinese package (thanks Anthony Fok).
  * [control] Provide the "cjk-latex" transitional dummy package
     inside this "cjk" package, not a separate "cjk-latex" package.  It
     saves quite some space (thanks Ming Hua).

     (thanks Ming Hua).
  * [control] Make some esthetical changes to the package descriptions.

  * Remove utils/hbf2gf/config.log when cleaning; the logfile remains
     when a prior debuild process was abruptly killed.
  * Depend on tex-common (>=0.14), because it fixes the creation of
     config.garuda and config.norasi.  Now `dvips -Pgaruda -Pnorasi bla.dvi´
     works like a charm, even if both garuda.map and norasi.map are disabled
     in /etc/texmf/updmap.d/10latex-cjk-thai.cfg, which is the whole point
     of using the -P option.
  * Depend on tetex-base (>=3.0), if you use teTeX.
  * Also support installation in TeXlive distribution, by depending on
     texlive-base-bin and texlive-latex-base in that case.  Thanks to
     Norbert Preining.
  * Add the "pinyin" Babel file and the "pyhyph" hyphenation pattern file.
     pyhyph is only useful for pinyin syllables  without accents.
     Install the "pytest.tex" example file as well.
     Mind though, the other "py_test.tex" is to test PinYin writing,
     not PinYin hyphenation.
  * Move the Thai Babel language file "thaicjk.ldf" to the correct place.
  * Provide our own Thai AFM and Type1 fonts again, rename them into
     8.3 style filenames (the default upstream procedure) and remove
     "thailatex" from the dependency list.
     Reason: thailatex is still incompatible with Debian's teTeX3 and
     TeXlive packages.
  * Fix the dh_link commands in debian/rules: remove the leading slash
     from the paths.
  * Do not build-depend on latex-cjk-chinese-arphic-* anymore.
  * Make the Perl scripts in /usr/share/latex-cjk/utils/ executable.
  * Install the Emacs Lisp scripts the Debian way.

  * Since the upstream source tarball is called "cjk-4.6.0", change the
     Debian source SONAME to "cjk" instead of "latex-cjk".
  * Remove the symbolic link from history.txt.gz to changelog.gz: the

  * Makefile: major cleanup and comment out redundant lines.

  * Depend on debhelper (>=4.2.32).  Yay!
  * Remove debian/*.conffiles; it's not needed anymore since debhelper 4.
  * Add the DVI files in the examples directory.
  * Run mktexlsr and update the map files after a purge (debian/*postrm)
     and installation (debian/*postinst).

latex-cjk (4.5.1+0.20030318-4.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * NMU.
  * Changing names because of interference with the original package.
  * I'm using the CVS version up to 2003-03-18, because I haven't managed

  * Added a THANKS file.

cjk-latex (4.5.1-4.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer release.
  * Fix broken font names in .fd and ttfonts.map files. (Closes: #322010)
  * Change "cyberb" into "cyberbit".  No need for ridiculous MS-DOS
     8.3 filenames on Debian.  This change is also affected in an NMU
     of freetype1-tools.
  * Big5, GB2312, CEF, Korean, Thai and UTF should work out of the box now;
     Japanese works too (JIS and SJIS encoding; HBF and DNP fonts).
  * Include Japanese, Korean and Thai fonts.  (Closes: #165350,
     #184187 and #67284)
     Thanks to Starosta for the Korean fonts from TeXlive.
  * Include PostScript versions of example files, just to show off.
  * debian/*: recode in UTF-8.

cjk-latex (4.5.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * CVS update as of 2003-02-11.
  * For configuring hbf2gf, the --with-kpathsea-dir option has been
     changed to --with-kpathsea-lib and --with-kpathsea-include, except
     that I was oblivious and did not notice the change to fix my
     Makefile.  Many thanks Atsuhito Kohda for catching this packaging
     bug.  (Closes: #183754)
  * Added hbf-kanji48 to Suggests and Description.  See Bug#183755
     for further development.

cjk-latex (4.5.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild to get the correct versioned dependency on libc6 (>= 2.3.1-1).
     Thanks to Daniel Mueller for the bug report.  (Closes: #168933)

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Nov 2002 01:49:04 +0800

cjk-latex (4.5.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Oops, I forgot to compile and install the new extconv utility.  Fixed.
     Thanks to Magnus Pfeffer for the bug report.  (Closes: #165355)
  * Installed existing man pages for *conv.
  * I'll fix the other issues at a later time, perhaps after reviewing
     Mike Fabian's excellent CJK LaTeX RPM for SuSE.  :-)

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Oct 2002 03:15:12 +0800

cjk-latex (4.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Note: This Debian CJK package is far from perfect.  There is lots
          of room for improvement, e.g. improving font settings and
          improving Japanese and Korean support (see Mike Fabian's SuSE
          CJK RPM).  Please feel free to give me criticism and suggestions
          by filing bug reports against cjk-latex!  :-)

cjk-latex (4.2.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * s/freetype-tools/freetype1-tools/g;
  * Added gen-arphic-map.pl to generate arphic.map installed in
     /etc/texmf/dvips/ .
  * Added experimental "embed Arphic PL Chinese TrueType fonts" support.
     Special thanks to Werner Lemberg, Yong Li (Rigel), and other TeXperts
     on pdftex and debian-chinese mailing lists for showing me how.  :-)

     Note: You need to manually add "map +p arphic.map" to your pdftex.cfg!

  * Added a note in README.Debian to describe this new feature.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Sun, 20 May 2001 16:34:21 -0600

cjk-latex (4.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-added "dpkg-divert --remove" in postrm and now also in preinst
     in case there is any old cruft leftover from 4.2.0-0.5 or before.
     Closes: Bug#77571.
  * Depends on libkpathsea3 instead of the old tetex-lib; Build-Depends
     is also changed accordingly.  Also Depends on the recompiled
     freetype-tools (>= 1.3.1-3) because older versions depended on tetex-lib.
     Closes: Bug#80118.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Dec 2000 15:23:57 -0700

cjk-latex (4.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Standards-Version: 3.1.1
  * [control] Also Suggests: tfm-arphic-{bkai,bsmi,gkai,gbsn}00{l,m}p
      Arphic PL TrueType fonts.  :-)
  * [README.Debian] Updated suggested list of Chinese font packages,
     added how to access the various fonts available for Debian,
     and made a note that tetex-bin (1.0.6-1) has added the HBF fontpath
     to T1FONTS.
  * Removed old, ugly kludges which diverted mktextfm and special.map
     from teTeX with our own.
  * Added appropriate c{00,10}{akai,kai,amng,ming,asng,song}{,r}.fd
     files for the Arphic PL fonts.  :-)
  * Added /usr/share/doc/cjk-latex/examples/Arphic_test.tex to showcase
     the newly packaged Arphic PL fonts.  :-)

cjk-latex (4.2.0-0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * [Makefile] Install cjk*.el in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisps.
  * [postinst] Use "/usr/bin/mktexlsr /usr/share/texmf" instead of
     just "/usr/bin/mktexlsr" to save time.
  * Added c00moekai.fd and c00moesng.fd.
  * [control]
     - Also Suggests: new Big5 TrueType font packages ttf-twmoe-kai
       and ttf-twmoe-sung.

cjk-latex (4.2.0-0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * [postrm] Add "|| true" in the dpkg-divert call so it won't
     complain to dpkg too much when "postrm upgrade" is run.
  * [control]
     - Also Suggests: new Big5 bitmap font package hbf-cns40-b5.
     - Removed the note about the preliminary status in the
       description.  cjk-latex now works out of the box!
       More or less anyway.  :-)
  * Updated README.Debian and TODO.Debian.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Apr 1999 13:34:17 -0600

cjk-latex (4.2.0-0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * [control] Suggests: hbf-jfs56 instead of jfs56
     because that font package has been renamed.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Apr 1999 17:40:23 -0600

cjk-latex (4.2.0-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * [control] Suggests: jfs56, the first Debian Chinese font
     package that works with cjk-latex!  Now, you should be able to
     generate Chinese GB-encoded .dvi files out of the box without
     tweaking CJK or teTeX's config files!  :-)  Other font packages
     will be added in the future (when I or others have more time.)
  * [Makefile] Oops, the hbf2gf configuration files were installed
     in the wrong directory.  Fixed.
  * [preinst,postrm] Added commands to divert /usr/bin/mktextfm and
     /usr/share/texmf/fontname/special.map.  First, to fix bug;
     second, to add CJK font names so the .tfm and .*pk files get
     created in the proper directories.
  * [postinst] Add the HBF font path to the T1FONTS variable in
     /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf.
  * Updated README.Debian.

 -- Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Apr 1999 04:02:01 -0600

cjk-latex (4.2.0-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Preliminary maintainer release #3.
  * Rebuilt with glibc-2.1 and tetex-lib (shared kpathsea library).
  * [Makefile] Changed $(prefix)/share/texmf to $(prefix)/lib/texmf
     for the new FHS-compliant directory layout in teTeX.
  * [control] Updated dependency to be FHS-compliant:
     - Depends: tetex-base (>= 0.9.990311-1), tetex-bin (>= 0.9.990310-1)
     - Recommends: freetype-tools (>= 1.2-4)
  * [postinst] Removed the hack which fixed a previous version of
     /usr/bin/mktexpk.  Since it has been fixed upstream in the latest
     teTeX, the hack is no longer needed.  Likewise, changed
     /usr/lib/texmf to /usr/share/texmf.

cjk-latex (4.1.3-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Preliminary Release.
  * Note: This Debian package is at a very preliminary stage.  The
    necessary font files are not packaged yet, and you may need to
    spend quite a bit of time tweaking teTeX's configuation files to
    get cjk-latex working.  Only for alpha testers and those in urgent
    need of cjk-latex.  :-)
