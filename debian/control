Description: LaTeX macro package for CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean)
 CJK is a macro package for LaTeX to enable typesetting in Chinese,
 Japanese, Korean and Thai, and it supports Vietnamese through the
 "vntex" macro.  And you can still use Russian, Greek and other
 languages in the same document.
 It supports various CJK encodings, like UTF-8, Big5, GB, JIS, KS,
 CNS (through CEF) and Emacs MULE.
 .
 This package will install the common files, as well as a few
 GNU/Emacs Lisp files, and it provides support for furigana
 ("ruby text") and PinYin, either with or without tone marks.

Description: XeTeX module of LaTeX CJK
 CJK is a macro package for LaTeX.  This package gives you the possibility
 to include Chinese (traditional and simplified), Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese,
 Korean, and many more scripts in your (La)TeX documents through XeLaTeX,
 which is based on the modern XeTeX engine.
 .
 It allows you to directly use TrueType fonts without any conversion or
 extra packages.
 .
 latex-cjk-xcjk suggests a whole bunch of Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Thai
 fonts that are guaranteed to work with xCJK, but any other TTF should work
 just as well.
 .
